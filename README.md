# Facial-Emotion-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
<h2>Facial Expression Recognition Using CNN and Flask</h2>

<p>This project focuses on recognizing human emotions by analyzing facial expressions captured through live video streams. The application is built using a <strong>Flask</strong> app to stream video from a local camera. <strong>OpenCV</strong> is utilized for facial feature extraction, where regions of the face are enclosed by contours. These regions serve as input to a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> model, consisting of six layersâ€”four convolutional and two fully connected layers. The CNN is trained to accurately identify emotions, showcasing the potential of machine learning in human-computer interaction.</p>
