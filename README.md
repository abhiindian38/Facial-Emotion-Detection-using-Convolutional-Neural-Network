# Facial-Emotion-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions by analyzing facial expressions captured through live video streams. The application is built using a Flask app to stream video from a local camera. OpenCV is utilized for facial feature extraction, where regions of the face are enclosed by contours. These regions serve as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, consisting of six layersâ€”four convolutional and two fully connected layers. The CNN is trained to accurately identify emotions, showcasing the potential of machine learning in human-computer interaction.
